Prototypes

Prototypes is my collection of prototypes that I have made. Including:
- Component system
- Commands
- Debugging, fps graph
- Basic 2D physics

There are several things that is going to be added, but they will be
added when I get the freetime to add them. Planned features are:
- Support for multiple gamepads
- Animations (animators)
- Parsing (In the form of a toy language)
- Improved debugging tools (switching between different graphs etc)
